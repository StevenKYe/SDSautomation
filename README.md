# SDSautomation
This project aims at optimizing the SDS geometry to find the highest SBS gain.

## TODO
- [ ] Add the autodetect neff feature
- [ ] Add the adaptive search algorithm for SBS gain
- [ ] Create script to visualize the results
- [X] Create the initial population
- [X] Create the second generation without mutation
- [x] Mutate the second generation
- [x] Add fprintf to indicate the status of the program
- [x] Increase the size of the population


## Issues
- [x] diffProp could become zero after several rounds
- [x] runCOMSOL result doesn't match with the appliction results
